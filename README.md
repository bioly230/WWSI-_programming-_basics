# Introduction

Hello, this repository was created out of the necessity to complete programming assignments for various computer science courses while studying informatics. As I progress in learning each programming language, you will find new directories related to each language.

## [Fundamentals of Programming, First Semester](/first_semester_C++/first_semester_C++.md)

1. Semester: First,
2. Subject: Fundamentals of Programming,
3. Scope: Basics of C++

To start, perhaps I'll begin by writing a program that displays the text ['Hello, World!'](/Hello_World_C++.cpp) in C++.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
```
